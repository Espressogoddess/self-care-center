# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built an app that allows users to receive random affirmation messages or mantra messages, depending upon which message type was chosen. Users can save their favorite messages and navigate to a favorited messages page to view them. Users can delete any of messages on the favorites page by clicking a delete button. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. From this page in GitHub, click the green `code` button, which shows a drop down menu.
1. In the drop down menu, click `SSH` and copy the SSH key `git@github.com:Espressogoddess/self-care-source.git`.
1. On your local machine, open the terminal and run `git clone [SSH key from last step]`.
1. `cd self-care-source` in terminal to move into the project directory.
1. `open index.html` in terminal to launch the application in the web browser.


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was completed in ~12 hours during my third week as a Turing student.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain knowledge and experience building an app from scratch utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Know how to utilize HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize my programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- It was challenging to effectively use CSS to alignment elements on the page to match the comp. I overcame this challenge with trial and error.
- It was challenging to wrap my head around the way in which to utilize the data model as the source of truth and using that to update the DOM. I compared and contrasted various approaches/solutions and analyzed them to figure out if it was using the DOM or data model and it began to make sense.
- A major win was figuring out the view logic for showing the message depending upon if affirmation or mantra was selected.
- A win was utilizing pseudocode to help with logic
- A win was also utilizing a feature branch that only implemented changes that aligned with that branch (which meant saving some features/changes for later while keeping the focus on the respective branch).
