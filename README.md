# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built an app that allows users to receive random affirmation messages or mantra messages, depending upon which message type was chosen. Users can save their favorite messages and navigate to a favorited messages page to view them. Users can delete any of messages on the favorites page by clicking a delete button. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. From this page in GitHub, click the green `code` button, which shows a drop down menu.
1. In the drop down menu, click `SSH` and copy the SSH key `git@github.com:Espressogoddess/self-care-source.git`.
1. On your local machine, open the terminal and run `git clone [SSH key from last step]`.
1. `cd self-care-source` in terminal to move into the project directory.
1. `open index.html` in terminal to launch the application in the web browser.


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- alignment was challenging and overcame with trial and error
- win: figuring out view logic for receive message (depending on affirm or mantra)
- win: utilizing pseudocode and a feature branch and only implementing changes that aligned with that branch (which meant saving some features/changes for later while keeping the focus)
- challenge wrapping my head around how to utilize the data model as the source of truth, i compared and contrasted various approaches or solutions and analyzed them to figure out if it was using the DOM or data model and it began to make sense.
